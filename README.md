# LangChain-Implementation-SCKGs
The first approach to generating SCKGs with a Python API eventually reached limitations not surpassable with that approach. Thus, the Spring Cybersecurity Capstone Cohort decided to implement an approach that would include realistic randomized data sets using LangChain and OpenAi's GPT 4.0 to implement the objects in STIX 2.0 standards. 
The initial approach with a Python API can be viewed at my fork of the main repository by Raj: https://github.com/Fatey96/STIX-LAS-Flask/tree/Ally-)
